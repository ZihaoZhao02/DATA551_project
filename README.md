# Mercedes-Benz Sales Insights Dashboard (2020-2025)

Deployed app link: **https://data551-project.onrender.com/**

This project is an interactive dashboard for Mercedes-Benz sales data from 2020 to 2025.

## Why this project
We are a student data consulting team.
Our main users are regional dealership managers.
They need simple evidence for inventory and display decisions.

## What users can do
- check fuel type trend by year
- check top-selling models
- compare price and horsepower patterns
- check top color choices
- filter data by year, model, fuel type, turbo, price, and horsepower
- use one reset button to clear all filters

## Dashboard layout
Main panels in the app:
- fuel type sales trend
- top models by sales
- price vs horsepower
- top colors

## Local setup
### 1) create environment (optional)
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 2) install packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3) run app
```bash
python src/app.py
```

The app will use this file by default:
`data/raw/mb_sales_sample_stratified.csv`

If you have the full raw dataset, you can rebuild samples with:
```bash
python src/build_samples.py
```

Then open the local link in your browser.
